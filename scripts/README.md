# New commands

`inspect_raw_images.py` starts with explicit original image files. It writes
linear/log-display projections, one native source slice, raw histograms and
byte/range provenance. No mask, reference, sampling or model is used.

```powershell
& ..\pointneuron2\tmp\pointneuron2\sampling_env\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\inspect_raw_images.py `
  --cases .\configs\phase1_raw_review.json `
  --output-dir .\tmp\my_raw_review
```

The case list contains two explicit training raw images, chosen by decoded size
within uint8/uint16 storage for initial inspection. They are not a representative
benchmark. Output directories must be new. See the
[Phase 1 design and inspected views](../docs/pn2_phase1_design.md).

`audit_image_inputs.py` decodes strict image-only cases and inventories every
spatial tile on CPU. It reads no reference, chooses no foreground threshold and
runs no model. See its [schema, command and verification](../docs/image_input_interface.md).
Output directories must be fresh and generated outputs belong under `tmp/`.

`evaluate_reconstructions.py` compares saved SWCs using explicit benchmark and
model-output JSON manifests. It never launches training or inference. The first
prediction manifest is the paired baseline. Each declared case remains visible,
including missing/invalid/empty outputs; reference-positive failures score zero
F1 in the macro average.

From the PN2 root, after creating manifests for actual saved outputs:

```powershell
& ..\pointneuron2\tmp\pointneuron2\sampling_env\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\evaluate_reconstructions.py `
  --benchmark .\configs\development_benchmark.json `
  --predictions .\tmp\comparison\PN2_control_outputs.json `
  --predictions .\tmp\comparison\PN2_candidate_outputs.json `
  --output .\tmp\comparison\report.json `
  --csv .\tmp\comparison\report.csv `
  --tolerances 2 6 --maximum-step 0.5 --check-convergence
```

The two prediction manifests above are paths to prepare, not existing
model results. Reports require fresh paths and are never overwritten.
The half-step convergence check reports numerical differences; the requested
step remains primary and there is no automatic convergence pass gate.

Only development/synthetic partitions are accepted at this stage. The explicit
seven-case inventory is development data. Distances use each case's declared
units; the defaults 2/6 are historical voxel settings, not universal physical
tolerances. Structural support does not establish topology accuracy.

See the [manifest and scoring contract](../docs/benchmark_contract.md) and
[verification record](../docs/evaluator_verification.md). No new training
command exists yet. Generated artifacts belong in `PN2/tmp/`.

The PN1-only `audit_reference_forward.py` has been removed from active source.
Its [historical report](../docs/reference_forward_interface.md) and pushed commit
`48519ff` preserve the detour; no PN1 rebuild is scheduled.
